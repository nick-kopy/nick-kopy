### Welcome!

Not long ago I was a graduate student but found myself more interested in the statistics driving research methods than I was in the study of psychology. I transitioned to data science, finding its process much like building and solving a puzzle at the same time. I just think itâ€™s amazing that we can give the data a meaning beyond the sum of its parts. I took a deep dive into some of the practical applications with Galvanize, collaborating with other data scientists on exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing. I now specialize in exploratory data analysis and data story telling. Moving forward I am analyzing bicycle related data to find trends, optimizations, or hidden gems. With the tools at our disposal, nothing is off limits in terms of what we can observe and improve.
